    <HelpAnswer
      question="Can I use Bitcoin anonymously?"
    >
      <p>
        It is not completely anonymous, but offers a great level of privacy
      together with transparency. It is not as anonymous as hard-cash, but
      its significantly more than credit card or bank transactions. Also,
      there are tools available and under development that promote privacy
      through Bitcoin, as well as technologies to protect against
      financial corruption and voting systems.

    <HelpAnswer
      question="Can I walk into a store and buy using Bitcoin?"
    >
      <p>
        Yes. Real stores are starting to accept Bitcoin as a payment
      currency, and its number increases by the day. Many online services
      offer convenient applications for both the consumer and the store to
      buy and sell very easily using Bitcoin. Now you can find many ATMs
      selling Bitcoin, but the number of 2-way ATMs (the ones that sell
      and buy) is increasing.

    <HelpAnswer
      question="What is Bitcoin Mining?"
    >
      <p>
        Similar to gold mining, Bitcoin mining is the process by which you
      digitally dig for Bitcoin, by running special scripts with
      algorithmic equations and hash functions that verify transactions on
      the blockchain. This process allows the confirmation of
      transactions, and adds new Bitcoin to the blockchain, and as a
      reward the miner receives Bitcoin.
